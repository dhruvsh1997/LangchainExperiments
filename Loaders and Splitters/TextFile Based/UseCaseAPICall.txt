most common use case for each of the API access techniques (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, Webhooks, Serverless) â€” explained with clarity and practical examples.

âœ… 1. REST API
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

Web and mobile applications interacting with standard CRUD APIs.

ðŸ›  Example:
A React/Flutter frontend gets data from your Django backend via /api/users/, /api/products/, /api/orders/.

Why it's used:
Simple

Well-supported by browsers, tools, and frameworks (like Django REST Framework)

Easy to cache and debug

âœ… 2. GraphQL
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

Frontend-heavy apps (like dashboards or mobile apps) needing flexible, nested data fetching.

ðŸ›  Example:
A React app shows a profile page with user info, latest posts, and their friends â€” in one query:

graphql
Copy
Edit
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts { title }
    friends { name }
  }
}
Why it's used:
Reduces the number of requests

Avoids over-fetching/under-fetching

Gives the frontend full control over what it needs

âœ… 3. gRPC
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

High-performance microservices-to-microservices communication inside backends.

ðŸ›  Example:
A machine learning model service talks to a recommendation engine service using gRPC.

A Golang payment service calls a user account service via gRPC.

Why it's used:
Super fast (binary over HTTP/2)

Strongly typed (protobuf)

Supports streaming

ðŸ“Œ Note: Not designed for browsers or public APIs.

âœ… 4. WebSocket
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

Real-time communication (bi-directional).

ðŸ›  Example:
Live chat apps (like WhatsApp web)

Live sports scores or stock tickers

Multiplayer game state updates

Why it's used:
Maintains an open connection (low latency)

Server and client can both push data at any time

Efficient for real-time interaction

ðŸ›  In Django, this is typically implemented using Django Channels.

âœ… 5. Webhooks
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

Triggering actions in one system from another system.

ðŸ›  Example:
Stripe sends a webhook to your Django app when a payment succeeds.

GitHub sends a webhook when a new commit is pushed to a repository.

Why it's used:
Asynchronous event-driven communication

Doesnâ€™t require constant polling

Great for automation (CI/CD, payment processing, etc.)

âœ… 6. Serverless Functions (like AWS Lambda, Vercel, etc.)
ðŸ”§ Most common use case:

On-demand, small-scale backend logic (without managing servers).

ðŸ›  Example:
An image resize function triggered when a user uploads a photo.

A webhook handler that validates a signature and logs a transaction.

Why it's used:
No server to manage or scale

Cost-effective for low-traffic or event-based tasks

Fast to deploy and run

ðŸ“Œ These can be used alongside Django, not usually instead of Django.
